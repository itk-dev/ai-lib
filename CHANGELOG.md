## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial Symfony 8 application scaffold.
- ITK Dev Docker setup via the `symfony-8` template (phpfpm 8.4, nginx, MariaDB, Mailpit).
- Dev dependencies for coding standards and composer normalization:
  `ergebnis/composer-normalize`, `friendsofphp/php-cs-fixer`, `vincentlanglet/twig-cs-fixer`.
- Project README with local development instructions.
- Frontend tooling: Tailwind CSS (via `symfonycasts/tailwind-bundle`),
  Symfony AssetMapper, and Stimulus (via `symfony/stimulus-bundle`).
  Decision recorded in [ADR 002](docs/adr/002-frontend-tooling.md).
- Base Twig layout (`templates/base.html.twig`) and frontend asset
  entrypoints (`assets/app.js`, `assets/styles/app.css`).
- Placeholder frontpage at `/` (`App\Controller\FrontpageController`)
  extending the base layout. Identifies the project and signals that
  the application is under construction.
- Functional smoke test for the frontpage
  (`tests/Controller/FrontpageControllerTest.php`); will start running
  once PHPUnit lands (#31).
- GitHub Action `block-on-label` that fails the check while a
  `do-not-merge` label is applied to a pull request, providing a
  per-PR merge gate for dependencies (e.g. another PR that must land
  first).
