## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `CLAUDE.md` with project-level operating instructions for AI agents
  (stack, structure, execution policy, branching, commits, CHANGELOG,
  ADRs, domain glossary).
- Initial Symfony 8 application scaffold.

### Changed

- README refocused as human-facing project documentation: project purpose,
  tech stack, and local development bootstrap. Developer command reference
  moved to `CLAUDE.md` (and later `CONTRIBUTING.md`, tracked in #9).
- ITK Dev Docker setup via the `symfony-8` template (phpfpm 8.4, nginx, MariaDB, Mailpit).
- Dev dependencies for coding standards and composer normalization:
  `ergebnis/composer-normalize`, `friendsofphp/php-cs-fixer`, `vincentlanglet/twig-cs-fixer`.
- Project README with local development instructions.
- Added develop branch
- `docs/adr/` with index (`docs/adr/README.md`) and ADR `001-tech-stack-docker-symfony`
  documenting the choice of Symfony 8 on the ITK Dev Docker `symfony-8` template.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` documenting branching, Conventional Commits, coding
  standards, changelog expectations and the pull-request workflow.
- Rewrite the project README around the AI Bibliotek catalog: adds project
  description, status banner, feature list, tech stack, Task-based local
  development workflow, contributing pointers, and prototype references.
